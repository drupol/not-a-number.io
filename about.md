I'm a developer who loves his work and likes to discover new things related to IT: I do things.

Drupal passionate and "working" as a Drupal Consultant, I maintain a couple of modules, teach Drupal to organisations and do some specific development upon requests.

I also like sciences in general and especially mathematics, that explains why I'm so fascinated by numbers and the way Nature uses them.

Besides my work and the geek stuff, I love music (_I'm learning to play electric guitar & piano!_), photography and swimming.
