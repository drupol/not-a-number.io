I'm a developer who loves his work and likes to discover new things related to IT: *I do things*.

Drupal passionate and "working" as a Drupal Consultant, I maintain a couple of modules ([check out my Drupal.org profile](https://drupal.org/u/pol)), teach Drupal to organisations and do some specific development upon requests.

I currently work in an amazing team at [the European Commission](https://www.drupal.org/european-commission) in Brussels and I'm always ready for new challenges.

I also like sciences a lot in general and especially mathematics, that explains why I'm so fascinated by numbers and the way Nature uses them.

Besides my work and the geek stuff, I love music (_I'm learning to play electric guitar & piano!_), photography and swimming.

Oh, and I couldn't finish this bio without having a word about my cat Izumi! He's the happiest cat in the world and it's also the first cat to have its own name in Drupal core thanks to [a patch I did some times ago](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules%21system%21system.api.php/function/hook_system_theme_engine_info/7.x).
