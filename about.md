I'm a developer who loves his work and likes to discover new things related to IT: *I do things*.

PHP developer, I used to work with Drupal since years, first as a hobby, then as a freelance.
I maintain a couple of modules ([check out my Drupal.org profile](https://drupal.org/u/pol)), teach Drupal to
some organisations and do some specific development upon requests.

Recently, I re-oriented my career and I'm now working with Symfony instead of Drupal. I will be working more on 
packages that are not tied to any framework or cms. You can follow my work on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/drupol/) or [Github](https://packagist.org/packages/drupol/).

I work in an amazing team at [the European Commission](https://www.drupal.org/european-commission) in Brussels and
I'm always ready for new challenges.

I also like sciences a lot and especially mathematics, that explains why I'm so fascinated by numbers and the way Nature uses them.
I'm fond of graphical visualisations of data, my favorites are the one from [Jason Davies](https://www.jasondavies.com/) ([bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/jasondavies)) and [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/) ([bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock)).
I also really like the [Nick Berry's blog](http://datagenetics.com/), I can't stop retweeting each of his post.

Besides my work and the geek stuff, I love music (_I'm currently learning piano!_), photography and swimming.

Oh, and I couldn't finish this bio without having a word about my cats Izumi & Nakano! They are the happiest cats in the
world and Izumi is the first cat to have its own name in Drupal core thanks to [a patch I did some times ago](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules%21system%21system.api.php/function/hook_system_theme_engine_info/7.x).
