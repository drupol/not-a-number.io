My job title is: Senior analyst... but it means all and nothing at the same
time.

More specifically, I'm a curious guy who loves his work and likes to discover
new things related to IT: *I do things*.

Core developer, I used to work with Drupal since years, first as a hobby, then
as a freelance.
I maintain a couple of modules ([check out my Drupal.org profile](https://drupal.org/u/pol)),
teach Drupal to some organisations and do some specific development upon
requests.

In 2019, after more than 10 years working with Drupal, I re-oriented my career
and I'm now working with Symfony instead. I will be working more on packages
that are not tied to any framework or cms.
You can follow my work on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/drupol/)
or [Drupol's Github](https://github.com/drupol/) or [Loophp's Github](https://github.com/loophp/).

I work at [the European Commission](https://www.drupal.org/european-commission)
in Brussels and I'm always ready for new challenges.

I love {{< abbr title="Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics" >}}STEM{{< /abbr >}} a lot and especially mathematics,
that explains why I'm so fascinated by numbers and the way Nature uses them. 
I'm fond of graphical visualisations of data, my favorites are the one from [Jason Davies](https://www.jasondavies.com/)
([His bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/jasondavies)) and [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/) ([His bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock)).
I also really like the [Nick Berry's blog](http://datagenetics.com/), I can't
stop sharing each of his [tweet](https://twitter.com/datagenetics).

My dream workplace would be a team of passionate, open-minded, non-paranoid and
friendly people.

I don't have any regret in my career at all, but if I had a chance to restart
it, I would most probably study Mathematics in depth and still do programming,
as those two sciences are tightly linked together.
I would also have liked to work in a university and teach students. I kinda miss
the school atmosphere.

Besides my work and the geek stuff, I'm currently fullfilling a childhood dream,
I'm learning piano!
I love photography and I learned by myself most of the secrets of a reflex
camera, just for fun.
I do swim a lot and I also really like riding my mountain bike.
Biking is also why I'm an heavy user and contributor of [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
since more than a decade.

Oh, and I couldn't finish this bio without having a word about my cats Izumi &
Nakano! They are the happiest cats in the world and Izumi is the first cat to
have its own name in Drupal core thanks to [a patch I did some times ago](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules%21system%21system.api.php/function/hook_system_theme_engine_info/7.x).
