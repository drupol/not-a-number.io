My job title is _Senior analyst_ but it means all and nothing at the same time.

As a highly curious individual, I am passionate about my work in Information Technology (IT) and enjoy discovering new
aspects of the field. Currently, I am employed at [European Commission] in Brussels, where I am always eager to tackle
new and exciting challenges. Twenty years after completing my bachelor's degree in Computer Sciences, I decided to
return to school during the Covid pandemic and to pursue a master's degree in the same field at [UMons University]. My
thesis is about "Reproducibility in Software Engineering" can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12666899.

As a Linux and FreeBSD enthusiast, I have worked as a full-stack developer with over a decade of experience in PHP. My
journey with Drupal began as a hobby, and I progressed to being a [contributor], service provider, and eventually, a
core maintainer.

In 2019, after careful consideration and a desire for new challenges, I [made the decision to resign as a Drupal core
maintainer] and shifted my career focus towards working with Symfony, a popular PHP web application framework. This
transition has allowed me to concentrate on creating framework-independent packages, broadening the scope of my work and
fostering innovation in the field of software development.

My passion for functional programming has also led me to become an avid user and contributor to the [NixOS] operating
system. NixOS is a unique, Linux-based operating system built on top of the Nix package manager, which offers several
advantages, such as customizable configurations and a strong focus on reproducibility. By contributing to the NixOS
community, I strive to enhance the system's capabilities and help make it an even more powerful and flexible solution
for developers and users alike. Recently, I've been promoted [NixOS committer][nixpkgs committer]. The [NixOS
repository][NixOS repository] being one of the most active repository on Github, it's a great honor for me to be part of
it.

If you are interested in following my work or staying up-to-date with my latest projects and contributions, I invite you
to check out my profiles on [Packagist], [Drupol's Github], [Loophp's Github] and [code.europa.eu]. These platforms
showcase my commitment to developing high-quality, versatile software solutions and my ongoing involvement in the
open-source community, where collaboration and knowledge-sharing are highly valued.

My love for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) is rooted in a deep fascination for Mathematics,
especially numbers and how nature utilizes them. Data visualization is another passion of mine, with my favorite works
coming from [Jason Davies] and [Mike Bostock]. I also hold great admiration for the late [Nick Berry's blog].

I envision my ideal workplace as one that fosters **open-source projects** and is filled with **passionate**,
**open-minded**, **non-paranoid** and **friendly** teammates.

Although I harbor no regrets regarding my career choices, reflecting on the possibility of starting anew presents an
interesting thought experiment. If given the chance to restart my career, I would undoubtedly immerse myself in the
study of Mathematics and Information Technology (IT), and work in a university. Both disciplines share a deep connection
that is particularly evident in programming, where mathematical concepts underpin numerous computational processes. By
delving deeper into these fields, I could further enhance my programming skills and uncover novel approaches to
problem-solving. There is something truly special about the atmosphere in a university. The vibrancy of intellectual
curiosity, the sense of community, and the camaraderie among both students and faculty members create an environment
that fosters growth and collaboration. I cannot help but feel nostalgic for those days when I was immersed in academia,
surrounded by the energy and enthusiasm of those committed to the pursuit of knowledge.

Besides my work and the geek stuff, I'm currently fulfilling a childhood dream, I'm learning music and piano! I love
photography and I learned by myself most of the secrets of a reflex camera, just for fun. I do swim a lot and I also
really like riding my mountain bike. Biking is also one of the reason why I'm an heavy user and contributor of
[OpenStreetMap] since more than a decade.

Lastly, I must mention my beloved cats, Nakano and remember the late Izumi. With Izumi even having a mention in Drupal
core, thanks to [a patch] I submitted some time ago.
