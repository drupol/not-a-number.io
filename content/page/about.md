My job title is _Senior analyst_ but it means all and nothing at the same
time.

More specifically, I'm a curious guy who loves his work and likes to discover
new things related to IT: *I do things*.

I currently work at [the European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu) in Brussels
and I'm always ready for new and exciting challenges.

Linux and Freebsd afficionado, full stack developer, I used to work with PHP
since more than 10 years.
I started with Drupal. First as a hobby, then as a contributor, then as a service
provider and finally as a core maintainer.
I still maintain [a couple of modules](https://drupal.org/u/pol), teach Drupal to some
organisations and do some specific development upon requests.

In 2019, after [resigning from being Drupal core maintainer](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3089877),
I re-oriented my career and I'm now working with Symfony instead. I will be
working more on packages that are not tied to any framework.
You can follow my work on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/drupol/)
or [Drupol's Github](https://github.com/drupol/) or [Loophp's Github](https://github.com/loophp/).

I love {{< abbr title="Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics" >}}STEM{{< /abbr >}}
a lot and especially Mathematics, that explains why I'm so fascinated by numbers
and the way Nature uses them.

I'm fond of graphical visualisations of data, my favorites are the one from [Jason Davies](https://www.jasondavies.com/)
([His bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/jasondavies)) and [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/) ([His bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock)).
I also really like the [Nick Berry's blog](http://datagenetics.com/), I can't
stop sharing each of his [tweet](https://twitter.com/datagenetics).

"_The best is the enemy of the good_", therefore my dream workplace would be to
work on open-source projects with a team of true, passionate, open-minded,
non-paranoid and friendly people.

I don't have any regret in my career at all, but if I had a chance to restart
it, I would most probably study Mathematics in depth and still do programming,
as those two sciences are tightly linked together.
I would also have liked to work in a university and teach students. I kinda miss
the school atmosphere.

Besides my work and the geek stuff, I'm currently fullfilling a childhood dream,
I'm learning music and piano!
I love photography and I learned by myself most of the secrets of a reflex
camera, just for fun.
I do swim a lot and I also really like riding my mountain bike.
Biking is also one of the reason why I'm an heavy user and contributor
of [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) since more than a decade.

Oh, and I couldn't finish this bio without having a word about my cats Izumi &
Nakano! They are the happiest cats in the world and Izumi is the first cat to
have its own name in Drupal core thanks to [a patch I did some times ago](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules%21system%21system.api.php/function/hook_system_theme_engine_info/7.x).
