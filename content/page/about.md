My job title is *Senior analyst* but it means all and nothing at the
same time.

More specifically, I'm a curious guy who loves his work and likes to
discover new things related to I.T.: *I do things*.

I currently work at [the European Commission] in Brussels and I'm always
ready for new and exciting challenges.

Linux and Freebsd aficionado, full stack developer, I used to work with
PHP since more than 10 years. I started with Drupal. First as a hobby,
then as a contributor, then as a service provider and finally as a core
maintainer.

In 2019, after [resigning from being Drupal core maintainer], I
re-oriented my career and I'm now working with Symfony instead. I will
be working more on packages that are not tied to any framework. You can
follow my work on [Packagist] or [Drupol's Github] or [Loophp's Github].

I love {{< abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics" >}}
STEM{{< /abbr >}} a lot and especially Mathematics,
that explains why I'm so fascinated by numbers and the way Nature uses
them.

I'm fond of graphical visualisations of data, my favorites are the one
from [Jason Davies] ([His bl.ocks]) and [Mike Bostock] ([His
bl.ocks][1]). I also really like the [Nick Berry's blog], I can't stop
sharing each of his [tweet].

"*The best is the enemy of the good*", therefore my dream workplace
would be to work on open-source projects with a team of true,
passionate, open-minded, non-paranoid and friendly people.

I don't have any regret in my career at all, but if I had a chance to
restart it, I would most probably study Mathematics and I.T. in depth
and still do programming, as those two sciences are tightly linked
together. I would also have liked to work in a university and teach
students. I kinda miss the school atmosphere.

Besides my work and the geek stuff, I'm currently fulfilling a
childhood dream, I'm learning music and piano! I love photography and I
learned by myself most of the secrets of a reflex camera, just for fun.
I do swim a lot and I also really like riding my mountain bike. Biking
is also one of the reason why I'm an heavy user and contributor of
[OpenStreetMap] since more than a decade.

Oh, and I couldn't finish this bio without having a word about my cats
Izumi & Nakano! They are the happiest cats in the world and Izumi is the
first cat to have its own name in Drupal core thanks to [a patch I did
some times ago].
